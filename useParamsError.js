In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the `useParams` hook outside of a component rendered within a route's scope will result in an error because the route parameters are not available in that context.  This often happens when trying to use parameters from within a parent component that wraps multiple routes or using them in a custom hook that isn't directly within a route component.
